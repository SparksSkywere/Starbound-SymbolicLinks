# Starbound-SymbolicLinks
PS script is for "Starbound", it is supposed to symbolic link steam workshop folders to "starbound\mods" for dedicated server modding 

1. When cloned you will need to copy the file to the server you are using it on, this can be client or dedicated, though Windows Server only because Linux doesn't use Regedit.
(Although if enough people needed it I can make a Linux version of this script but will need powershell installed).

A. If you want to use the PS1 file, open a powershell console (Or Terminal) with Administrative rights, then locate the file and then type ".\SB-Modding-Symolic-Links.ps1"

B. If you want to use the EXE file, right click and run as administrator

3. Check that the links have appeared in "INSTALLDIR\Steamapps\Starbound\mods", I have done lots of testing to make sure it did work but sometimes a messy mod can cause an issue.

4. Run server and enjoy.
